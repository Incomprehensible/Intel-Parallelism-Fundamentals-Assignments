# Intel-Parallelism-Fundamentals-Assignments
Assignments from the course Fundamentals of Parallelism on Intel Architecture. 
Given reference code, tasks, and goals, wrote vectorized, parallel and distributed C++ code using OpenMP and MPI, well optimized for specialized Intel high-performance processors (Xeon and Xeon Phi family). Through assignments, I learnt to exploit the internal parallelism (up to 72 cores) of the CPU, optimizing code performance & memory access.
Ran and tested code on Colfax remote cluster (access provided by Coursera) & analyzed compiler-generated code performance reports.

## Week 2
Vectorized code for Monte Carlo Diffusion, using capabilities of AVX-512 SIMD.

## Week 3
Wrote multithreaded version of the code for filtering.

## Week 4
Explored Knight's Landing high-bandwidth memory & cache managing modes, tools and techniques.
Optimized the Fast-Fourier Transform workload.

## Week 5
Distributed the FDM calculations for physics simulation of a string vibration, using MPI.
